SCRUM by Jared

Pied Piper Agile Management Application

### About
This repository is a mock of an extremely simple Sinatra application, "JSCRUM", which demonstrates how to integrate **FusionAuth** 
for user management. Users are able to login, logout, view and update profile
information, logout, and delete their accounts. 

FusionAuth is a platform and framework agnositc modern CIAM tool to integrate authentication, authorization and
user management into your applications. FusionAuth supports many applications in one easy to use browser interface. Features are exposed in API's that allow flexibility and customizable user experiences. In this tutorial we will demonstrate integrating FusionAuth with the light-weight Ruby framework Sinatra.

The application uses the [FusionAuth Ruby client library](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/ruby). The API will provide all of the necessary methods
to create user access management with FusionAuth in Sinatra.

### Set Up

### Run
